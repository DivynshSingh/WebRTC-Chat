user
    -has freinds that he can recieve messages from
    1> asks server periodically if a connection request for user has arrived
        if yes:
            keeps connection with the server until all p2p webRTC connections to freinds have been built
             and then talks to freinds
            if connection breaks:
                asks 
    2> tells server it wants to connect to some guy, if server finds them as freinds server proceeds otherwise server tells requester to first send a freind req


    user - u<n>
    server - s

    u1 - send s req 'i wanna talk to 'u2', server recieves req and replies with ok i will let you know when he ready to tok
                                                                                        s here only acknowledges 
    u1 - ask s periodically anyone wanna talk 'u1'
    usign mqtt now, mmuch better then periodic polling.





u - connects to server through websocket, keep alive
  - when send message - send list of [users] i wanna talk to
  - recieve list of [users] that wanna talk to me
